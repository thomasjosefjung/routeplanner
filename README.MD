# DHBW Routeplanner Demo

## Description

ASP.NET Application to demonstrate how classic shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra and A*) can be used to implement a simple navigation system. The raw graph data is stored in the graph_bab.xml and graph_teaching.xml files. Find the graph logic itself in the subfolder and namespace graph. 

Frontend is done using vanilla JS and BULMA CSS Framework. 

Have fun!
